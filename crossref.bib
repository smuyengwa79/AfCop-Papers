  abstract={ This study examines the impact of climate change on cropland in Africa, using a Ricardian cross-sectional approach. Relying on farm data from an 11-country survey of over 9500 farmers, annual net revenue is regressed on climate and other variables. The study confirms that current climate affects the net revenues of farms across Africa. Applying these results to possible future climates reveals that dryland farms are especially climate sensitive. Even as early as 2020, climate change could have strong negative impacts on currently dry and hot locations. By 2100, dryland crop net revenues could rise by 51\% if future warming is mild and wet but fall by 43\% if future climates are hot and dry. The crop net revenues of currently irrigated farms are likely to be least affected.},
